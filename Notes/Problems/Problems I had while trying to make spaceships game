Problems I had while trying to make spaceships game
3/22/15

-IncreaseAttributeBy and DecreaseAttributeBy don't work
 -"attributeBy" vs "attributeName"
 -Event.changeAttribute doesn't exist
 -They assume they are being passed an object, but should use name/id
   -Split into different functions for player, card, zone

-Value comparisons don't use gamestate
 -Should use gamestate and get passed name/id instead of object reference

-Cannot get attribute value from card

-Some sort of system to get a player's associated zone. Perhaps in JSON?
(In this game each player has a Ships zone: "P1 Ships" and "P2 Ships")
 -Also, getting the other player's associated zone

-Get what zone a card is in

-Check what phase the game is in. (Maybe have an isInPhaseX() function?)

-Do something to the first/last card in a zone

-Do something to each card in a zone

-Do something to each card in a zone...
  -Of a type
  -Meeting certain requirements

-Winning / losing

-Get the current player
