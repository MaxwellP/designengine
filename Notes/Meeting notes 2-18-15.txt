Engine fixes

Designing on-the-fly
-Zone identifiers
-Everything was through lookups, causing problems now?

No name changing : set a name at the start. Delete old one and make new one if the name must change

Be able to make the JSON in design gui

API
-API functions should have NO side effects on the gamestate
-Anything that does should go in Event
-Should have a naming structure for functions that are expected to be used as arguments for a higher order function
-Gamestate should be first argument for functions
-Finish what you have
-Make a tutorial - explain concepts, give examples

Other
-Find instances of object passing instead of ID passing
-Non-card actions
-"Universe" system: assign a universe to a card for more intelligent sampling
-Card Types: a string that places a card in a group
 -Multiple types
 -Permanent property
  -Declare beforehand
